hi and welcome to the machine learning because of grief in New Jersey so we're going to talk about today is what is machine learning well this is the world and in the world we got humans and computers and what are the main differences between humans and computers as humans learn from past experience first computers need to be told what to do to be programs we follow instructions now the question is can we get computers tools  from experience 2 and the answer is yes we can and that's precisely with machine learning is of course for computers past experiences have a name called Data it's on the next few minutes I'm going to show you a few examples in which we can teach the computer how to learn from previous data and most importantly I'm going to show you that machine learning is really nothing to fear so let's go to the first attempt  find housing market on our task is to predict the price of a house given it sucks so we have a small house that cost $70,000 we have a big house that cost $160,000 and would like to estimated price of this medium-sized house to here so how do we do it where the x-axis represents the size of the house and square feet and the y-axis represent the price of the house in dollars and soda help us out  collected some previous date on the form of these blue dots these are other houses that we've looked at him we recorded their prices with respect to their size so in this graph we can see how the small house is priced at $70,000 and the big house is priced at $160,000 turn off Cypress Mall quiz what do you think is the best guess for the price of the meeting house given this data will be $8,000  $120,000 or $190,000 want to help us out we can see the Blue Points kind of front of line so we can draw the line that best fits the data on this line we can say that our best guess for the price of the house is this point over here which corresponds to $120,000 so if you said $120,000 that is correct this method is known as the linear regression  are you may ask how do you find his line well let's look at a simple example this three points we're going to try to find the best line that fits through those three points obviously best line subjectable to try to find a line that works well for teaching her how to do it computer in the eyeball the line so have to get it to draw random line and then see how bad this line is  see how bad the line is calculate the error so we're going to look at the lights of the distances from the line to the three points and was going to Simply Save the error of this line is to some of those three red length now we're going to do is remove line around and see if we can reduce his out so let's say we move in the direction can we calculate the air skin by the yellow distances  and realize that we can fix the error so that's not a good direction to go in the other direction we move it here got to leave the error now it's given by the sum of these three green distances seed of the earth smaller so we actually reduced it so let's say we take that stuff we're a little closer to our solution doing this procedure several times we will always be decreasing the error on a silent gun rights to a good solution in the form of the  is General procedure is known as gradient descent now in real life we don't want to deal with negative distances course going to a point being on one or the other side of the line so we do to solve this is add the square of the distance from the point of the Lion's Den and this procedure is called the least squares DeSantis trying to the central or Mountain Resort  Mount Everest this mountain the higher we are the larger errorist so descending means reducing the error so what are we doing the try to the same amount it will look at our surroundings and try to figure out which way we can to send more for supper here we can go through directions to the right or to the left left and we going up in Star error to sending is equivalent to moving the line down person getting farther from the three points  body we go to the right instead then we're actually the sending error is decreasing this is equivalent to movie lineup words and getting closer to the three points so we decide to take a step towards right then we can start this procedure again and again and again until we successfully descend from the mountain is equivalent to reducing the error to find its minimum value which gives the best line of fit  you can think of linear regressions Angel to look at your data Android the best fitting line or a problem or even a higher degree or simple the data here we can actually hear that okay so let's move to the next example in this example  we're going to build an email spam detection classifier so something that will tell us if an email is Spam or not and how do we do this we just by looking at 3DS data the previous data is Hungry Mouse that has looked at already out of this a hundred emails we have flag 2500 spam and seven five of the most not spam now it's trying to think of features of spam emails may be likely to display  and analyze this features so one feature could be containing the word cheap seems reasonable to think that I'm email containing the word ship is likely to be spam so let's Analyze This Clean we look for the word cheap in all these a hundred emails and find that 20 out of spammers and five out of the non spam ones contain that word so we can forget about all the rest of the email and focus only on the ones that contain the word cheap  okay so time for a quiz here's a question based on our data if an email contains the word cheap what is the probability of this email being spam is it 40% 60% or 80% well to help us out we can see that out of the 25 emails with the word cheap 20 of them are spam  I need them are not so these form an 80/20 split so the correct answer with 8080 regret the from analyzing the data we can conclude a rule the rules test if an email contains the word cheap then we're going to say the probability if it's being spam is 80% so we can associate this feature with a probability 80% and we're going to use it the flag few  messages as spam or not spam we can also look at other features and try to find her Associated from Billy disable the Cardinals continue spelling mistake and realized that the probability of an email continue spelling mistake being spam is 70% or less able to get emails are missing a child and finally probably leave those being Spanish 95% etcetera Etc so now in future emails, can combine these features to guess if they're scam or not  algorithm is known as the naive Bayes algorithm so now another example we are the app store or Google Play on our goal is to recommend apps to users so to each user we're going to try to recommend them after they are most likely download we have gathered a table of data that we're going to use to make the rules on the table contains six people Detroit 06  we have recorded their gender and their age and the app to download it so for example the first person is a 15 year old female and she downloaded Pokemon go so here's a small quiz between gender and age which one seems like the more decisive feature for predicting what app will the users download want to help us out first Mystic agenda  you can speak about gender than the females downloaded Pokemon go on What's That where's the mail is downloaded Pokemon go on Snapchat so not much of a split here on the other hand if we look at age we realize that everybody was under 20 years old download Pokemon go where is everybody who is 20 or older didn't that's a nice but so the feature that best fits the data is H there for a few said age that was correct  so we're going to do is when I had a question here the question is are younger than 20 if yes then will recommend Pokemon go to you if not then we'll see so what happened to your 20 or older then we look at the gender it seems like here if your a female you've downloaded what's up recipe your mail you've downloaded Snapchat so we had another question here the question is are you  female or male or female we were coming what's up your mail in Snapchat when we end up here is with a decision tree and the decisions are given by the question we asked and this decision tree was built with the data and now whenever we have any user we can forward them to the decision tree and recommending whatever after tree suggested to recommend example  a young person you recommend them Pokemon go yeah I know the person you check the gender if it's a female you recommending what's up it's a meal you're coming in Snapchat obviously there will always be a tree that perfectly fits our data but in this class we're going to learn an algorithm which acting will help us find the best-fitting tree to table of data  okay so let's go to the next example missions office at University and we're trying to figure out which students to admit we're going to admit them or reject them Basin two pieces of information one is an entrance exam that we provide them the test and the other one is their grades from school so for example here we have student one with scores of 9 out of 10  and 8 out of 10 in the grace and that accept it we also have student to what score 7-3 in the test and four in the grades and that student did not get accepted and then it's two incomes in student three scores of 7 and 6 and the question is should we accept them or not so let's first put them in a grid where the x-axis represents our scoring  test and the y-axis represents their great are we going to see that student one would live over here in the point with coordinates 98 since their scores where is nine and eight and the student to would live here in the point with coordinates and 3/4 since the scores were three and four so hard to see if we should accept or reject two and three we should try to find a training that data so we look at the previous data in the form of all the students we've already accepted or rejected and it  looks like this a green dots represent students that were previously accepted students that were previously rejected so what time for quiz based on the previous data do we sing student 3 gets accepted yes or no how to answer this question let's the closing of the data the red and green. Seem to be nice be separated by a line here's a  and most of the points over at are green and most of the points under 8 are red with some exceptions which makes sense are over the line and they got accepted scores are underlined and they didn't get accepted so we're going to say the deadline is going to be your model and now every time you get a new student will check the scores and let them at this graph and if the end up over the line with petite Adelle get accepted and at the end of the line was pretty jacked  so since students 3 has greater 7 + 6 person will end up here at the .76 which is over the line so we can clear that the students get accepted so if you said yes that's the correct answer this method is known as logistic regression now the question is how do we find this line at Best Cuts the date and to so let's look at simple example  .3 green 3 red and we're going to try to draw a line that separates the green points from the red point and again it computer can't read the line so and just started by drawing a random line like this and give him the sly in this just randomly say that we label the region over the line is green and the region on the line as red so just like was in regression we're going to try to see how bad this first line is and a measure of how bad the line is  would be how many points are we miss classifying we're going to call that number misclassified points the error this line for example misclassified two points one red and one green so will say that it has two errors so again like within her aggression what we'll do is move the line around and try to minimize the number of Errors using gradient descent  direction we can see that we start correctly classify one of the boys bring you and if we move it a little more in reality since we use calculus for a gradient descent method of Errors is not open yet to minimize but instead something that captures the number of Errors called the lock lost function the idea behind the function is that it's a function  the large value to the Miss classified points on a small value to the quest 5 Points so let's look more carefully this model for accepting or rejecting students and one of the greats so the student gets accepted going to remodel since they are over here on top of the line but that seems wrong at very low grades and get accepted  what their test score was so maybe simplistic to think this data can be separated by Just One Lie right maybe the real data should look more like this where the students over here I got a low test score a little Grace don't get accepted so now it seems like a line won't cut the data into so what's the next thing after line maybe a circle circle could work maybe two lines I can work too  looks like that works better so let's go with that now the question is how we find these two lions again we can do it using gradient descent to minimize a similar log last function as before this is called in neural network why is it called the neural network well let's see we have the screen area here buying about two lions this area can be constructed  name the intersection between the greenery on top of water lines and the green arrow to the right of the other one of the lines so we're kind of like this and it separates a plane into two regions and the two knows we get the intersection which of the desired area the reason why this is called the neural network is because it mimics the behavior of the brain in the brain we have the neurons which connect to each other and either fire electricity or  they resemble the notes in our draft we split the Plains region fire electricity for given point belongs to one of those regions and one fire if it doesn't we can't explain regression Ninja Turtles Okay so  deeper into the arts training day into two and three red and there seem to be many lines that can split them for example there is a yellow line and there is this purple light so quiz which of these two lines do you think us the data better the purple one or the yellow one well if you look at the yellow line seems that it's close to failing its  close to two of the points of where the wiggle it a little bit we would misclassify some of the points the purple on the other hand seems to be nicely spaced as far as we can from all the points so it seems like the best line is a purple now the question is how do we find the purple line for the first time survation is that we don't really need to worry about these points because they're too far from the boundary so we can forget about them and only phone  the points that are closed and now we're going to use is not gradient descent but we're going to be used to be near the main station to find the line that maximizes the distance from the boundary points this method is called a support Vector machine so you can think of support Vector machines the surgeon who will see your data and cut before she will carefully look at what's the best way to separate the day  and then make the cut okay so now let's say we have these four points arranged like this and we want to split them seems like a line won't do the job since they're already over the line and the red ones are on the sides and the green ones are in the middle so we need to think outside the box one way to think outside the box is too used to curve like this to split them another one  virtue think outside the plane think of the points is lying in three-dimensional space here are the points over the plain and here we are next to access the z-axis for the third dimension and if we can find a way to lift it to bring points then we'd be able to separate them with a plane so what seems like a better solution over here or the Flash  are here well it turns out that these two are actually the same method sorry if it seems confusing will get into a little bit more detail later this method is called used to support Vector machines so let's study one of them in more detail so it's this one is a .03 this one is 1/2 to 1  this one is 3-0 and what we need is a way to separate the green points from the red points so the points coordinates are X Y then we need an equation on the variables X & Y the Jesus large values for the green points and small values for the red points or vice versa so quiz which of the following equations could come to a rescue x + y  6 x y or ask where the first coordinate Square this is not an easy question so that's actually make it table with the values of these equations on each other four points so here's our table here we have the four points on the top rope now you should be all the roast will be one of the functions so here's a sum x + y Sharon the first row  0 + 3 is 3 1 + 2 + 3 2 + 133 + 0 3 now for the second row the products zero one time two ways to 2 * 1 is 2 and 3 times 0 is 0 and for the third row square is a first coordinate Square so she was squared is 0-1 squared is 1 2 squared is 4 + 3  what is 9 so let's think which one of these equations separates the green and the red points we look at the sum x + y and that gives us 3 at every value so it doesn't really separate points you can look at x squared and that uses different values for every point but we get zero and nine for the red values and 1 and 4 for the green ones so this one also  doesn't separate them and I will look at the product X x y and that is a zero for the red values and two for the green ones so that one seems to do the job right is a function that can tell them apart the basket question we're going to use see the products here and now for the red points X, Y we have that the product X Y equals 0  and for the green points we have the product X Y equals 2 what's the price of zero on a 2-1 so the equation x y equals one will separate them and what is x y + 1 + 8 y equals 1 over X and the graph for y was one of her ex's precisely this hyperbola over here that is the current we want it so that is a crown  now we can also see it in 3D here we have the point 0 3 1 2 2 1 and 3 0 and we're going to consider them three space so we're going to take the map that takes the point x, y to X, Y, X X Y so where does 0 3 go 0 to 0, 3, 0  since the product of 0 and 3 0 want to go to one, two, to so it goes all the way up to the third coordinate is the height .21 also goes 2, 1, 2 and .30 goes to 3, 0, 0 so there we out we can split the Museum of play so you can think of a sport Vector machine kernel method as a surgeon we saw slightly confused  it's an apples and oranges all of a sudden she comes up with a great idea if you had consist of moving the apples up and the orange down and then successfully cutting a line through between them okay so let's move the next example let's say we have a chain of pizza parlors a piece of the most Wendy's locations  and so we need to know where are the optimal places to put our 3 pizza parlors well it seems like a house or nicely split into three groups the red the blue one the yellow so it makes sense to put one pizza parlor in each one of the three clusters but we're teaching computer how to do this like computer just eyeballed the three clusters we need an algorithm so here's one of those work 3 random locations for the pizza parlors  so they're here where the stars are located red blue and yellow that would make sense to say you should go to the pizza parlor that is closest in that case we can look at the map like this where the yellow houses go to the yellow pizza parlor the blue houses score of the Blue pizza parlor and the red houses go to the red pizza parlor now where the yellow  allocated you would make a lot of sense to move the yellow pizza parlor to the center of these houses anything west of blue houses and the red houses so let's do that let's move every piece of parler to the center of the house is that it serves as follows now look at this blue points that are a lot close to the yellow pizza parlor then to the blue one so we might as well call them yellow  look at these red points there closer to the blue pizza parlor then to the red so less color than blue now let's do the step again let's send each pizza parlor to the center of this house is that is serving in this way but then again look at these red house is there so much closer to the blue pizza parlor so let's turn them blue Anthony pizza parlor to the center of a cow's is it service  and now we're pushing optimal solution so starting with random points and it raining this process help us reach the best locations for the pizza parlors this algorithm is called K means clustering but now let's just say we don't want to specify the number of clusters to begin with the different way to group the houses so say their range like this it would make sense to save a phone  two houses are closed they should be served by the same pizza parlor so if we go by this rule let's try to group the houses let's look at which houses are the closest to each other it's this to over here Subway group 2 now what are the next two closes houses it's these two were here so we Krypton the next to closest houses are these two so again a group  the next to closest house are these two so we United groups now the next to Hauser here so we grab them the next Too Close are here so we joined the group's the next to closest house are here but now let's just say that's too big so all we need to do is specified distance to say this distance is too far when you reached his distance stop clustering the houses and now we are clusters  the song Rhythm is called hierarchical-clustering so congratulations in this video with learned many of the main algorithms machine learning we learn to find you a house prices using linear regression we learn to detect spam email using I would like to recommend apps using decision trees to create a model for an admissions office using logistic regression we learn how to improve them using neural networks  I will learn how to prove it even more using support Vector machines and finally we learn how to locate pizza parlors around a city using clustering algorithms so many questions man racing had such as are there more algorithms the answer is yes which ones to use that's not easy given a dataset how do we know which algorithm to pick how to compare and evaluate them given to algorithms how do you know which one is better than another one.  set give me the running time their accuracy etcetera are there examples of the projects are there real life. Data that I can get my hands dirty with them the answer to all these questions are more or in the Udacity machine learning nanodegree so if this interests you you should take a look at it thank you
